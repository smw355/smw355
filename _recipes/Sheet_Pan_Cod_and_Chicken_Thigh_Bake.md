| Sheet Pan Cod and Chicken Thigh Bake with Cauliflower, Peppers, and Carrots | 2025-01-15 |

## Ingredients

* 2 cod fillets (about 6 oz each)
* 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
* 1 head of cauliflower, cut into florets
* 2 bell peppers, sliced
* 3 carrots, peeled and sliced
* 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* Any seasoning that sounds good
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Prepare the Vegetables and Chickpeas**: In a large bowl, combine the cauliflower florets, sliced bell peppers, sliced carrots, and chickpeas. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and season with your choice of seasoning, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat the vegetables and chickpeas evenly.

3. **Arrange on Sheet Pan**: Spread the seasoned vegetables and chickpeas evenly on a large baking sheet.

4. **Prepare the Chicken Thighs**: Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Place the chicken thighs on the baking sheet, nestling them among the vegetables and chickpeas.

5. **Bake Chicken and Vegetables**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes.

6. **Add Cod Fillets**: Pat the cod fillets dry with paper towels. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. After the chicken has baked for 15 minutes, add the cod fillets to the baking sheet, ensuring they are not overlapping with the chicken or vegetables.

7. **Continue Baking**: Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken thighs are cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F) and the cod is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.

8. **Serve**: Remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes before serving.

Enjoy your healthy and flavorful sheet pan meal!
